This is the final project in Introduction to Programming.

This project mimics a school system and allows students to drop and register in courses.

The teacher will also be able to display the scores.

Courses contain assignments, which hold weight and have max scores.

The address will contain the street number, the street name, the city, the province and the postal code.

The student will have an ID, a name, a gender, an address and a department in which he studies.

After being validated, the assignments' average will be calculated for all the students.

Every student, department and course names will be in title case.

The scores for each student in their assignment will be randomly generated.

The department, student, assignment, and the course will all have a specific ID with a specific format.
